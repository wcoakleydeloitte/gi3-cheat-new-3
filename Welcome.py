It will analyse technical information about a project and benchmark it against publicly available information. It does this by identifying and documenting readily available technologies and/or solutions that closely match your project from the Internet and describes the specific differences. All information will be analysed and cross-referenced with online sources to provide a complete audit trial. You will receive a customised report, carefully configured to enable you to rapidly understand the current state of technology. The tool can be used to conduct vendor or competitor reviews, business case option analysis, R&D tax claims and more.
 
Simply upload your project information, and let the tool do the rest.""")
